                    <h4>Video Game project</h4>
                    <p>We are currently in the early stages of the design of a video game project inspired by the first volume of the novel. We want a first person roleplaying game: trapped in a megatower, a merc needs to do his job and get out before he is out of time. We want a fully fleshed building, complete with water, electricity, Internet, trash and other commodities network, so the player can use them to progress in the story.</p>

                <div class="projectTile">
                    <h4>Comics</h4>
                    <p>Inspired by Greek mythology and a 1837 French short novel titled <i>La Vénus d’Ille</i> (Ille’s Vénus), by Prosper Mérimée, Eidolon is a story about two young lovers who elope into a ruined city to marry at the feet of the statue of the goddess of love. However, events take a worrying turn: the statue comes to life and goes after the groom, while the bride is taken by an ill-willed conspirator. Helped by a savant and an enchantress, they must fight to survive, reunite and love again.</p>
                    <p>The synopsis is done. The script is ongoing revisions. We are looking for partners to make this project a reality.</p>

                <div class="projectTile">
                    <h4>Tabletop game</h4>
                    <p>Eidolon would make an exciting tabletop chase and problem solving game. It would be best as a hybrid game, mixing in digital elements.</p>
                    <p>For the time being, we are not looking for partners for this side of the project, since we already have some names in mind.</p>

                <div class="projectTile">
                    <h4>Video Game and Movie</h4>
                    <p>For the time being, we concentrate our efforts on Digital Gods and Fallen Angels, but we are open for discussion. We feel Eidelon would do great in both media. A video game would require to modify the script extensively, and we are absolutely open to this possibility and even have a very basic design in mind, rarely seen before.</p>

            <h2>Interactive table</h2>
                <p>We also design new kind of devices. We are currently looking for funds to produce interactive tables, with applications pertaining to gaming, education, arts and design.
                    
                <h3>Functions</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Input and output communication channels using sound, image, and touch. Main channel: interactive table surface.</li>
                        <li>Projectors would allow usage of walls and projection screens to multiply the display surfaces.</li>
                        <li>Able to detect the position of what is laid on it. If useful, it might also detect the position of users and follow their gestures.</li>
                        <li>Tables would connect to each other and constitute a network of interactive hot points.</li>
                        <li>Exchanging productions is at the heart of the project, and a peer-to-peer marketplace is integral to it.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>The interactive space includes not only the table, but also the volume around it.</p>

                <h3>Why?</h3>
                    <p>The project revolves around three main objectives</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Interactivity:</b> users will have a larger array of inputs and outputs to play, work and create, including voice, pointers, controllers touch, sound and images. Since it’s meant for transmedia applications, it requires a lot of capabilities.</li>
                        <li><b>Conviviality:</b> nowadays, most digital equipment is meant for a single user or a few users facing a screen. Our users will face each other in an interactive space. Linking tables together will create a network of interactive hot points. Several tables in the same place would ideally be able to conjugate their spaces.</li>
                        <li><b>Creativity:</b> we want to turn automation and digital tools into production means to enhance creativity, not to create instead of the user. Bringing several users in a high interactive space will also foster creativity.</li>
                    </ul>
